Important points to know in functions

FUNCTIONS:
===========
Intro of multiple employes or multiple customers of a bank.
1.A function is a block of code for some specific operation.
2.Function Code is re-usable
3.A function executes only when it is called.

def 
call 

The rules for naming a function are a lot like rules for naming a variable:
a-z;A-Z;0-9;_
They must start with a letter or an underscore: _.
They should be lowercase.
They can have numbers. But Can't start with a no.
They can be any length (within reason), but keep them short.
They can't be the same as a Python keyword.
don't include space.



Types of functions:
=====================
1)Built-in function
len,id,type,min,max
2)User defined function

Call a func in another func.

========================

def Bank_details():
    print("The SBI branch is in : Hyderabad")
    print("IFSC code for your bank is: 12345678")
def Customer_details():
    print("Acct holder name: Rounak")
    print("Date of birth: 11-08-1995")
    print("Available balance as of today: 10000000000000")
Bank_details()
Customer_details()

Scope of variable:
==================
1)The location where we can find a variable and also access it if required is called the scope of a vartiable.
2)Local and Global Variables.
If both variable are there in a Script local as well as global>>> Local var is given priority.
>>How to make local as global>> "global" 

Func with arguments and parameter or positional arguments.

>>>Func with return.
>>>default argument display(a=1), if display (4), 4 is considered if no argument than 1 is considered.
	default arg should be placed at last.
>>> Func with keyword argument (a=4,b=8)
>>> Variable lenght arguments(*arg)
>>>Variable based keyword arg(**arg)
